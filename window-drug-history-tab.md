# **DRUG HISTORY TAB**
---
The **Drug History** tab enables you to check the current patient’s history of prescribed medication. The Daley Dose application syncs with the online database to provide the latest updates (within 1 hour) on the patient’s digital records.  

This tab is useful when checking for previous prescriptions from other doctors or hospitals. This includes local, national, and international records, as long as the previous prescribers used the Daley Dose application.  

Because the **Drug History** tab syncs with the database each time you view it, the application requires an internet connection to use this functionality. The loading time of the information also depends on the current internet speed.
