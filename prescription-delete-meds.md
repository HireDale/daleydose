2. The application enables **Delete Mode** and displays checkboxes next to existing entries in the **Prescription** tab.  
3. Select the checkboxes for the entries you want to delete.  
4. Select the **Delete** button to remove the selected entries from the current prescription.  
5. The application displays the confirmation message **"Are you sure you want to delete this from the prescription?"** before removing the medication from the list.
