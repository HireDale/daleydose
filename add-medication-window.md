## **NOTES**
---
- You must have the **Prescriber** role to view this window.  
- See [**About User Roles**](/daleydose/about-user-roles) for more information.  
- Your device must be connected to the internet to add medications. The Daley Dose database cross‑checks the entered patient’s diagnoses with the medications you are allowed to prescribe.  
- The application prevents you from adding medication when the **Patient name** field is empty.  
- You can add up to 5 medications per prescription.  
- The application auto‑completes generic and brand name suggestions for each medication by default. You can turn off this feature in the **Options** window.  
- An **Administrator** or **Support** user can impose or remove a **Prescription restriction** on a **Prescriber**.  
- See **Prescription restrictions** for more information.
