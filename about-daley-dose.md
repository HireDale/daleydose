# **About Daley Dose**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Daley Dose application streamlines the prescription writing process for healthcare professionals.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Its easy-to-use interface and powerful features enable accurate, efficient, and secure management of prescriptions. It also has far-reaching capabilities, being able to contact patients, pharmacies, and even online stores for accurate and on-time medication distribution. This ensures that patients get their medication on time and at their convenience.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
With the help of the various Daley Dose features at your disposal, you can even assign alternatives to medications in the event the pharmacy or store has no current stock. This enables the other end of the prescription process to have more flexibility when it comes with supplies. And this also means that patients will always receive their prescriptions and will not have to leave the pharmacy empty-handed.
