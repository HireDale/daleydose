# **CUSTOM APPLICATION THEMES**  
---
Who says medical software has to be boring? Soon, you will be able to pick a Daley Dose custom theme from over a hundred options! Featured themes include Dark Mode, Dr. Mario, and Breaking Bad. 

We are especially proud of the **Resident Evil** theme — complete with health status indicator and an accurately animated 2D avatar of the patient (AI-generated yet _tastefully_ done, mind you). Here, the health indicator dynamically shifts to reflect the patient’s current condition based on their last digital hospital record update.

This genuinely puts the FUN in functionality — finally!

The **Custom Themes** feature of the application rolls out early 2029. This will be included in the standard package of the Daley Dose subscription.

Follow us on our social media channels for sneak peeks, feature spotlights, and behind‑the‑scenes updates as we get closer to launch. We’ll be sharing early demos, integration tips, and ways you can be among the first to test new capabilities.
