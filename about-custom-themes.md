# **CUSTOM APPLICATION THEMES**  
---
Who says medical software has to be boring? Soon you’ll be able to pick your favorite Daley Dose theme or wallpaper — whether it’s soothing teal for calm consultations or neon pink for that extra “vital sign alert” flair. Finally, your desktop can look as healthy as your patients… or at least as lively as your coffee‑fueled late‑night charting sessions.  

Featured themes include **Fallout Wasteland**, **Dr. Mario**, and **Pharmacy Simulator**. 

We are especially proud of the **Resident Evil** theme — complete with health status indicator and an animated 2D patient avatar (AI-generated and _tastefully_ done to preserve anonymity while maintaining a professional, immersive, yet fun aesthetic). The health indicator dynamically shifts to reflect the patient’s current condition, giving you a clear, at‑a‑glance view of their status as recorded within the past hour.

This genuinely puts the FUN in _functionality_ — finally!

The **Custom Themes** feature of the application rolls out early 2027. This will be included in the standard package of the Daley Dose subscription.

Follow us on our social media channels for sneak peeks, feature spotlights, and behind‑the‑scenes updates as we get closer to launch. We’ll be sharing early demos, integration tips, and ways you can be among the first to test new capabilities.
