## **NOTES**

- The application requires 200 GB of storage space and an active internet connection throughout the entire installation process.  
- Newer versions require Windows 11 or equivalent.  
- For best results, a 4080 graphics card or higher is recommended to help manage the workload.  
- While the application is running on your computer, you may notice increased processing activity. This is normal and expected, especially during prolonged use.
