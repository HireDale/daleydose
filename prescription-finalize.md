# **FINALIZE AND SEND OUT A PRESCRIPTION**  
---

To finalize and send out a prescription, follow these steps:

1. Select the medication you want to add an alternative for, then select the **+ Alt** button on the left toolbar.  
   - *(Optional)*  
   - When you select this button, the application displays the **Add Alternative** window.  
   - You can add an alternative option for the pharmacy in case the prescribed medication is not available.

2. Select the **+ MD Sig** button to add your saved digital information at the bottom of the prescription.  

   **NOTES**  
   - The signature includes the prescriber’s full name, medical license number, contact information, and known office address.  
   - This is a required field for finalization.  
   - You must have a medical signature template saved in the **Profile** window to use this functionality.

3. Finalize the prescription.  
   - Select **Send** to send the current prescription’s information to the Daley Database.  
   - The application sends the prescription to the patient via a secure, one-time-use QR code. The patient can use this QR code to fill the prescription at a partner pharmacy.  
   - Select **Print** to use a local printer connected to your device and create a hard copy of the patient’s prescription.

## **PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER**
---

### The application prevents you from selecting the **+ Alt** button  
- **REASON:** The prescription is currently empty, or you have not selected which medication to create an alternative option for.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that you have selected a medication on the **Home** window and try again.

### Error message when entering alternative medication name: **"Identical Medication"**  
- **REASON:** The alternative medication name you entered is the same as the original.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that the alternative medication you enter is different from the original.

### The application prevents you from selecting the **+ MD Sig** button  
- **REASON:** The application does not have your saved digital signature.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that you have completed entering information in the **Medical Signature** panel on the **Profile** window.

### The application prevents you from selecting the **Send** button  
- **REASON 1:** The application does not have access to the internet.  
- **SOLUTION 1:** Ensure that your device is currently connected to the internet.  
- **REASON 2:** The application is still checking the Daley Database for confirmation.  
- **SOLUTION 2:** Wait a few minutes and try again. The application needs to confirm the patient name, diagnosis, and prescribed medications before finalizing.

### Error message: **"Patient Mobile Not Found"**  
- **REASON:** The patient has a saved profile on the Daley Database, but their phone cannot be contacted.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that the patient’s mobile device has an internet connection. The application needs a solid connection to send the QR code that the patient can use to refill the prescription.

### Error message: **"Unable to Contact Servers"**  
- **REASON:** The application cannot process your request because it needs to consult the Daley Database.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that the internet connection remains consistent throughout the process and try again.
