The **Generate** buttons of the **Action Sidebar** are the **Add Medical Signature**, **Print Copy**, and **Send Online**. As a safety measure when dealing with medical prescriptions, these three buttons are disabled by the application until you have finalized your work.
After adding medications and notes to the prescription, select the **Finalize** button to lock the prescription entries in place and prepare the prescription for printing or online sending.

The application disables the **Finalize** button when there are errors in the current prescription. The application highlights fields with errors in red. You can also see an error message indicating the nature of the error on the same line as its source.

## **ADD MEDICAL SIGNATURE**
---
Select the **+ MD Sig** button to add your saved digital information at the bottom of the prescription.  

   - The signature includes the prescriber’s full name, medical license number, contact information, and known office address.  
   - This is a required field for finalization.  
   - You must have a medical signature template saved in the **Profile** window to use this functionality.
 
## **PRINT COPY**
---


## **SEND ONLINE**
---

Finalize the prescription.  
   - Select **Send** to send the current prescription’s information to the Daley Database.  
   - The application sends the prescription to the patient via a secure, one-time-use QR code. The patient can use this QR code to fill the prescription at a partner pharmacy.  
   - Select **Print** to use a local printer connected to your device and create a hard copy of the patient’s prescription.

## **PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER**
---

### The application prevents you from selecting the **+ MD Sig** button  
- **REASON:** The application does not have your saved digital signature.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that you have completed entering information in the **Medical Signature** panel on the **Profile** window.

### The application prevents you from selecting the **Send** button  
- **REASON 1:** The application does not have access to the internet.  
- **SOLUTION 1:** Ensure that your device is currently connected to the internet.  
- **REASON 2:** The application is still checking the Daley Database for confirmation.  
- **SOLUTION 2:** Wait a few minutes and try again. The application needs to confirm the patient name, diagnosis, and prescribed medications before finalizing.

### Error message: **"Patient Mobile Not Found"**  
- **REASON:** The patient has a saved profile on the Daley Database, but their phone cannot be contacted.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that the patient’s mobile device has an internet connection. The application needs a solid connection to send the QR code that the patient can use to refill the prescription.

### Error message: **"Unable to Contact Servers"**  
- **REASON:** The application cannot process your request because it needs to consult the Daley Database.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that the internet connection remains consistent throughout the process and try again.
