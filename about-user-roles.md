# **ABOUT USER ROLES**
---

The Daley Dose application offers multiple user roles, each with distinct functions and restrictions. Roles can be assigned to an account and follow a linear hierarchy for escalating technical issues during troubleshooting.

To request a role change, contact **Support** or an **Administrator**.
