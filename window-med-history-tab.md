The **Med History** tab enables you to review the current patient’s history of medical conditions and treatments. This tab is read-only and serves as a reference utility to support more accurate medical care.

By reviewing the patient’s medical history, the prescribing physician gains a broader clinical context and can tailor treatment accordingly. This is especially useful when prescribing medications that may interact with past conditions or ongoing therapies.

The **Med History** tab is one of three tabs featured in the **Work Area** of the Daley Dose application, alongside the [**Prescription**](/daleydose/window-prescription-tab) and [**Drug History**](/daleydose/window-drug-history-tab) tabs.

## **NOTES**
---
- The **Action Sidebar** retracts to a more minimal pane to provide additional space for the **Consultations** panel.
- The information in the **Med History** tab is read-only.

## **LIMITATIONS**
---
- Medical records older than the year 2000 must be manually digitized by their originating hospitals, clinics, or institutions before they can appear in the **Med History** tab.
- Legal restrictions may prevent certain records from being displayed. For example, sealed court records or privacy-related exclusions may limit visibility.
- Because the **Med History** tab syncs with the database each time you view it, the application requires an internet connection to use this functionality. The loading time of the information also depends on the current internet speed.
