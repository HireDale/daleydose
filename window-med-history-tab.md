The **Med History** tab enables you to check the current patient’s history of medical conditions and treatments. 

The **Med History** tab is one of three tabs featured in the **Work Area** of the Daley Dose application, alongside the [**Prescription**](/daleydose/window-prescription-tab) and [**Drug History**](/daleydose/window-drug-history-tab) tabs.

The application divides this tab into two sections: **Current Status** and **Medical Records**.  

The **Current Status** section displays information about the patient’s ongoing or most recent medical issue. This enables prescribers to access quick context about the patient’s current prescription needs.  

The **Medical Records** section provides a detailed list of the patient’s medical conditions and treatments, going back up to 20 years. If earlier records have been digitized and uploaded to the database, the Daley Dose application can also provide that information.  

Because the **Med History** tab syncs with the database each time you view it, the application requires an internet connection to use this functionality. The loading time of the information also depends on the current internet speed.
