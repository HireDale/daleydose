# HOME WINDOW
---
You will perform most of your work in the **Home** window of the Daley Dose application.  
In this window, you can create medical prescriptions for your patients. Each prescription can include up to five medications. You can also scan physical prescriptions and convert them into a digital version.

The **Home** window appears when you start the Daley Dose application. By default, it opens with the last saved instance of a previous prescription (if any), allowing you to continue where you left off. You can disable this feature in the **Options** window.

For more information about the tasks you can perform in this window, see the *User Interface Guides* topic.
