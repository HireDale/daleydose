You will be doing most of your work on the <strong>Daley Dose</strong> application from the Home Window.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the <strong>Home Window</strong>, you can create medical prescriptions for your patients. From here, you write <strong>up to 5 medications</strong> per prescription. You can also scan <strong>physical prescriptions</strong> and convert them into a digital version.

<p style="text-align: justify;">  
The user interface displays the Home Window when you start the Daley Dose application. The Home Window, upon starting the application, enables you to view and continue from the last saved instance from a previous prescription (if any). You can disable this feature from the <strong>Options Window</strong>. The application enables this feature by default.
