# **HOME WINDOW**
---
You will perform most of your work in the **Home** window of the Daley Dose application.  
In this window, you can create medical prescriptions for your patients. Each prescription can include up to 5 medications. You can also scan physical prescriptions and convert them into a digital version.

The **Home** window appears when you start the Daley Dose application. By default, it opens with the last saved instance of a previous prescription (if any), allowing you to continue where you left off. You can disable this feature in the **Options** window.

For more information about the tasks you can perform in this window, see the **User interface guides** topic.
