# **SIGN UP AND LOGIN GUIDE**
---

After installing the Daley Dose application or its mobile companion app, you must first log into the system before you can view the main interface and prescription features.  

This requires an active Daley Dose account with system‑assigned login credentials (a username and a temporary password) or the use of **Spectator Mode**.

## **SPECTATOR MODE**
---

You can log into the application without an account or valid credentials using **Spectator Mode**. This allows you to explore the application without creating an account.

To log into the application using Spectator Mode:

1. On the **Login Screen**, select the **Support** dropdown.  

2. In the dropdown list, select **Continue as Guest**.  

3. Select **Continue** on the confirmation dialog box.

**NOTES**  
- Spectator Mode disables all prescription features and most of the user interface.  
- The main purpose of this mode is to allow potential customers to view the application before purchasing a subscription or license.

## **ACCOUNT CREATION**
---

To obtain login credentials, you must have an active Daley Dose account or be part of a group with an active account. Registration is completed on the Daley Dose website.  

You can sign up as a single practitioner or as a representative of a health care group.

### **SIGN UP PROCESS (SINGLE PRACTITIONER)**

To sign up as a single practitioner:

1. Go to the Daley Dose website.  

2. Select the **Register** button to display the **Account Creation** page.  

3. On the **Account Creation** page, enter the required information in the **Personal**, **Professional**, and **Financial Information** sections.  

4. Select a subscription plan.  

5. Select **Finalize** to proceed to the **Payment** page.  

6. Confirm and provide your payment to complete the process.  

After payment, the website emails you a unique username and a temporary password. You can then log into the Daley Dose application.

### **SIGN UP PROCESS (HEALTH CARE GROUP)**

To create accounts for a hospital, company, or team of practitioners, you must contact Daley Dose Corporate Representatives.

To sign up for a corporate setup:

1. Go to the Daley Dose website.  

2. Select the **Corporate** button to display the **Corporate Account Creation** page.  

3. On the **Corporate Account** page, enter your company’s contact information. 

   A customer service representative will call after confirming your company, required number of accounts, and payment details.  

4. The representative will guide you through the sign‑up process.  

After selecting a subscription plan and finalizing payment, your company must wait for account setup:  
- About 1 week for triple‑digit accounts.  
- At least 1 month for accounts exceeding 1,000.  

Once created, the website sends bulk login credentials to your company’s IT department, which distributes them to the health care team.
