# **ABOUT PRESCRIPTION RESTRICTIONS**
---
Administrators can impose or lift various levels of prescription restrictions on active Prescribers.

Orders to impose or lift restrictions must come from the hospital’s Department Head or higher. This process requires official hospital paperwork, an explanation, and the specified duration of any restrictions. The Prescriber receives a notification about any changes in prescription restrictions the next time they open the application.

You can view a Prescriber’s restrictions in the options.
