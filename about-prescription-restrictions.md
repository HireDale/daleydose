# **ABOUT PRESCRIPTION RESTRICTIONS**
---
Administrators can impose or lift various levels of prescription restrictions on active Prescribers.

Orders to impose or lift restrictions must come from the hospital’s Department Head or higher. This process requires official hospital paperwork, an explanation, and the specified duration of any restrictions. The Prescriber receives a notification about any changes in prescription restrictions the next time they open the application.

You can view a Prescriber’s restrictions in the [**Options Window**](/daleydose/window-options).

The following table describes the prescription restriction options available in the Daley Dose application:

| **USER ROLE** | **DEFINITION** |
|---------------|----------------|
| **NO RESTRICTIONS** | The Prescriber has no medication restrictions for prescriptions. However, prescribed medication must align with the patient’s current diagnosis saved in the Daley Dose database.<br><br>**NOTE:** The application sets this option as the default for newly added prescription accounts. |
| **RESTRICT SCHEDULE II** | The Prescriber cannot add Schedule II medication to their Daley Dose prescriptions, regardless of whether the patient profile permits its administration. |
| **RESTRICT SCHEDULE II AND III** | The Prescriber cannot add Schedule II or Schedule III medication to their Daley Dose prescriptions, regardless of whether the patient profile permits its administration. |
| **RESTRICT SCHEDULE II, III, AND IV** | The Prescriber cannot add Schedule II, Schedule III, or Schedule IV medication to their Daley Dose prescriptions. |
| **ONLY OTCS** | The Prescriber can add only over‑the‑counter (OTC) medication to their Daley Dose prescriptions. |
