# **ABOUT PRESCRIPTION RESTRICTIONS**
---
Administrators can impose or lift various levels of **prescription restrictions** on active Prescribers. This prevents them from prescribing specific medication for a stated period of time.

Orders to impose or lift restrictions must come from the hospital’s Department Head or higher. This process requires official hospital paperwork, an explanation, and the specified duration of any restrictions. The Prescriber receives a notification about any changes in prescription restrictions the next time they open the application.

You can view the details of a Prescriber’s restrictions in their profile.

The Prescriber cannot add **Schedule II** or **Schedule III** medication to their Daley Dose prescriptions, regardless of whether the patient profile permits its administration.

### **CONTROLLED PRESCRIPTION LOCK**
The Prescriber cannot add **Schedule II**, **Schedule III**, or **Schedule IV** medication to their Daley Dose prescriptions.

### **MAXIMUM RESTRICTIONS**
