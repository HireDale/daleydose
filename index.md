# **PRODUCT OVERVIEW**
---

The **Daley Dose** application streamlines the prescription‑writing process for healthcare professionals.

Its intuitive interface and powerful features enable accurate, efficient, and secure management of prescriptions. It also offers extended capabilities, including contacting patients, pharmacies, and online stores for accurate and on‑time medication distribution. This ensures that patients receive their medication promptly and at their convenience.

With the various Daley Dose features at your disposal, you can assign alternatives to medications when the pharmacy or store has no current stock. This gives the dispensing side of the prescription process more flexibility in managing supplies and ensures that patients receive their prescriptions without leaving empty‑handed.

- **Digital Assistant Support**  

  Coming soon to every Daley Dose application — meet **Dale Bot**, your always‑on, AI‑powered prescribing assistant. Dale Bot drafts prescriptions for you, leaving only the final review and signature in your hands. _Review optional._

  Say goodbye to tedious manual entries and the mental gymnastics of checking drug interactions. You have better things to do! Now, you can let AI handle the heavy lifting while you focus on… well, anything else.  

  Picture this: Dale Bot will decide for you whether Mr. Smith gets 250 mg of mefenamic acid or a 100 mg of morphine — all while you’re halfway through your coffee or catching up on last night’s episode. It’s the future of prescribing: consistent, accurate, and blissfully _low‑effort_.  

  With Dale Bot, the only thing left on your to‑do list might be figuring out how to thank a robot for making you look this efficient.

- **Application Themes**  

  Who says medical software has to be boring? Soon you’ll be able to pick your favorite Daley Dose theme or wallpaper — whether it’s soothing teal for calm consultations or neon pink for that extra “vital sign alert” flair. Finally, your desktop can look as healthy as your patients… or at least as lively as your coffee‑fueled late‑night charting sessions.  

  Featured themes include **Fallout Wasteland**, **Dr. Mario**, and **Pharmacy Simulator**. We’re especially proud of the **Resident Evil** theme — complete with health status indicator and an animated 2D patient avatar (AI-generated and _tastefully_ done to preserve anonymity while maintaining a professional, immersive, yet fun aesthetic). The health indicator dynamically shifts to reflect the patient’s current condition, giving you a clear, at‑a‑glance view of their status as recorded within the past hour.

  This genuinely puts the FUN in _functionality_ — finally!
