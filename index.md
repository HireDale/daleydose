# **PRODUCT OVERVIEW**
---

The **Daley Dose** application streamlines the prescription‑writing process for healthcare professionals.

Its intuitive interface and powerful features enable accurate, efficient, and secure management of prescriptions. It also offers extended capabilities, including contacting patients, pharmacies, and online stores for accurate and on‑time medication distribution. This ensures that patients receive their medication promptly and at their convenience.

With the various Daley Dose features at your disposal, you can assign alternatives to medications when the pharmacy or store has no current stock. This gives the dispensing side of the prescription process more flexibility in managing supplies and ensures that patients receive their prescriptions without leaving empty‑handed.

## **COMING SOON**

### **AI Integration**
Coming soon to every Daley Dose application — **Dale Bot**, your AI‑powered prescribing assistant. Dale Bot can draft prescriptions for you, leaving only the final review and signature in your hands.  

This reduces manual entry and helps prevent drug interaction errors. Dale Bot’s responses are consistent, accurate, and available 24/7 — no coffee breaks required.  

For those who like to live on the edge, you can even watch Dale Bot decide whether Mr. Smith gets 250 mg of mefenamic acid or a bold 100 mg of morphine. (Don’t worry — it’s all simulated… probably.) Pure adrenaline for the conscientious clinician. And yes, Dale Bot’s bedside manner is impeccable: it never complains, never forgets, and never takes a vacation.

### **Application Themes**
Who says medical software has to be boring? Soon you’ll be able to pick your favorite Daley Dose theme or wallpaper — whether it’s soothing teal for calm consultations or neon pink for that extra “vital sign alert” flair. Finally, your desktop can look as healthy as your patients… or at least as lively as your coffee‑fueled late‑night charting sessions.

Featured themes include **Darker than Black**, **Dr. Mario**, and **Resident Evil** — complete with health bars and an animated patient avatar whose movement changes with “health” status. At full green, they walk normally. Drop to yellow and they clutch their sides. Hit red and they stagger like they’re one step from the grave. It’s the perfect nod to classic survival horror — now in your prescribing software.
