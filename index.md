# **PRODUCT OVERVIEW**
---
The **Daley Dose** application streamlines the prescription‑writing process for healthcare professionals.

Its easy‑to‑use interface and powerful features enable accurate, efficient, and secure management of prescriptions. It also has far‑reaching capabilities, including contacting patients, pharmacies, and online stores for accurate and on‑time medication distribution. This ensures that patients receive their medication on time and at their convenience.

With the various Daley Dose features at your disposal, you can assign alternatives to medications when the pharmacy or store has no current stock. This gives the dispensing side of the prescription process more flexibility in managing supplies. It also ensures that patients receive their prescriptions without leaving the pharmacy empty‑handed.
