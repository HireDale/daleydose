# **ADD NOTES WINDOW**

In the **Add Notes** window, you can add notes to the prescribed medication.  

Pharmacies print a copy of the medications and their associated notes when the patient comes in to fill the prescription.  

**Suggested notes include:**  
- Number of doses per day  
- Whether the dose should be taken with or without meals  
- Special instructions before or after taking the dose  
- Whether the medication requires test results before taking  

To view this window: **Prescription** tab > Under the medication entry you want to add a note > **Add Note** (blue **Plus**)
