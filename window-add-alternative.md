## **NOTES**
---
- Your device must be connected to the internet to add medications. The Daley Dose database cross‑checks the entered patient’s diagnoses with the medications you are allowed to prescribe.  
- The application prevents you from adding alternative medication when the prescription is empty.  
- You cannot set the same medication as its alternative option.  
- The application auto‑completes generic and brand name suggestions for each medication by default. You can turn off this feature in the options.
