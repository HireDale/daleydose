To add an alternative option to a medication entry in the current prescription, follow these steps:

1. Select the medication entry you want to create an alternative for, then select the **Add Alternative** button (**Alt+**) on the **Prescription** tab to view the [**Add Alternative** window](/daleydose/window-add-alternative).

2. In the **Add Alternative** window, enter either the generic or brand name of the medication in their respective fields.
   - The **Generic Name** field is mandatory, while the **Brand Name** field is optional.
   - You cannot enter the original medication entry as its own alternative.

3. If you enter a brand name while the **Generic Name** field is empty, the application automatically lists the brand nameâ€™s generic version in that field.
   - The application auto-completes generic and brand name suggestions for each medication.
   - You can turn off this feature in the options.

4. Enter the medication dosage.

5. Enter the amount of medication you want to prescribe.

6. Select **OK**.
   - When the pharmacy runs out of the prescribed medication, the pharmacist can provide the alternative instead.
   - The application disables the **OK** button when at least one of the following fields is empty: **Generic Name**, **Dose**, or **Amount**.

### Error message when entering medication name: **"Medication Unknown"**

### Error message: **"Unable to Contact Servers"**
