## **PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER**
---

### The application prevents you from selecting the **Add Notes** button  
- **REASON:** The current prescription has no medication listed.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that you have at least one medication listed on the current prescription.

### Error message: **"Note Too Long"**  
- **REASON:** The current note has over 25 words and cannot be processed.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that the note stays under 25 words.

### Error message: **"Unable to Contact Servers"**  
- **REASON:** The application cannot process your request because it needs to consult the Daley Database.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that the internet connection remains consistent throughout the process and try again.
