You will perform most of your work in the **Home** window of the **Daley Dose** application.  

In this window, you can create medical prescriptions for your patients. Each prescription can include up to 5 medications. You can also scan physical prescriptions and convert them into a digital version.

The **Home** window appears when you start the **Daley Dose** application. By default, it opens with the last saved instance of a previous prescription (if any), allowing you to continue where you left off. You can disable this feature in the options.
