# **ADD NOTES WINDOW**

In the **Add Notes** window, you can add notes to the prescribed medication.

**Suggested notes include:**  
- Number of doses per day  
- Whether the dose should be taken with or without meals  
- Special instructions before or after taking the dose  
- Whether the medication requires test results before taking  

**To view this window:**  
- On a new prescription: **Home** > **Create new** > Select an entered medication > **+ Notes**  
- On an existing prescription: **Home** > Select an entered medication > **+ Notes**
