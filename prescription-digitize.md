# **DIGITIZE A HANDWRITTEN PRESCRIPTION**
---

To digitize a handwritten prescription, follow these steps:

1. Select **Scan Physical Copy** on the **Prescription** tab.

   **NOTES**
   - Generating a new prescription based on a scanned physical copy erases all current work loaded on the **Prescription** tab. Make sure to **Send**, **Save**, or **Print** any ongoing prescriptions before you continue.
   - If there are items on the current prescription, the application displays the confirmation message **"Are you sure you want to erase the current prescription?"** The application erases all populated fields when you select **Yes**.
   - The application only displays the **Scan Physical Copy** button on the desktop version when your computer has a confirmed connected webcam.
   - The application always displays the **Scan Physical Copy** button on the mobile app.

2. Check the status of the **Camera** and **Internet** fields.
   - You need both fields to show green to continue.

3. Aim the camera at the note and select **Capture**.
   - The application scans the handwritten prescription using your computer or phone’s camera to create a digital version of the prescription’s contents.

4. Wait for the scan to complete.
   - The entire process can take up to 20 seconds.
   - The application takes multiple photographs during this time to ensure accuracy.
   - Make sure the note remains visible throughout the entire duration to avoid errors.

5. After a successful scan, the application enters all processed information on a new prescription.

   **NOTES**
   - You cannot edit medications or notes on a scanned prescription.

## **PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER**
---

### Error message on the **Scan Physical Copy** button: **"Unable to Access Camera"**
- **REASON:** The phone, desktop, or laptop camera is not connected, broken, or does not exist.
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that the camera is connected to the device before you try again.

### Error message during transfer: **"Unable to Detect Prescription"**
- **REASON:** The application cannot detect a handwritten prescription note.
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that the prescription is visible on the camera for the full duration of the transfer.

### Error message during transfer: **"Unable to Decipher Hieroglyphics"**
- **REASON:** The Daley Dose Scanning Algorithm cannot understand the prescriber’s handwriting due to poor handwriting or camera quality.
- **SOLUTION:** Try using a different camera or device. If the problem persists with the same note, manual input is required.

### Error message: **"Unable to Contact Servers"**
- **REASON:** The application cannot process your request because it needs to consult the Daley Dose Database.
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that the internet connection remains consistent throughout the process and try again.
