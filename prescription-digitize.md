# **DIGITIZE A HANDWRITTEN PRESCRIPTION**  
---

To digitize a handwritten prescription, follow these steps:

1. On the **Home** window, select **Create New**.  

   **NOTES**  
   - Creating a new prescription erases all current work loaded on the window. Make sure to **Send** or **Print** any ongoing prescriptions before you continue.  
   - If there are items on the current prescription, the application displays the confirmation message **"Are you sure you want to erase the current prescription?"** The application erases all populated fields when you select **Yes**.

2. Select the **Scan** button.  

   **NOTES**  
   - The application only displays this button on the desktop version when your computer has a confirmed connected webcam.  
   - The application always displays this button on the mobile app.

3. Check the status of the **Camera** and **Internet** fields.  
   - You need both fields to show green to continue.

4. Aim the camera at the note and select **Start**.  
   - The application scans the handwritten prescription using your computer or phone’s camera to create a digital version of the prescription’s contents.

5. Wait for the scan to complete.  
   - The entire process takes 20 seconds.  
   - The application takes multiple photographs during this time to ensure accuracy.  
   - Make sure the note remains visible throughout the entire duration to avoid errors.

6. After a successful scan, the application enters all processed information on a new prescription window.  

   **NOTES**  
   - You cannot edit medications or notes on a scanned prescription.

## **PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER**

### Error message on the **Scan** button: **"Unable to Access Camera"**  
- **REASON:** The phone, desktop, or laptop camera is not connected, broken, or does not exist.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that the camera is connected to the device before you try again.

### Error message during transfer: **"Unable to Detect Prescription"**  
- **REASON:** The application cannot detect a handwritten prescription note.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that the prescription is visible on the camera for the full duration of the transfer.

### Error message during transfer: **"Unable to Decipher Notes"**  
- **REASON:** The Daley Dose AI algorithm cannot understand the prescriber’s handwriting due to poor handwriting or camera quality.  
- **SOLUTION:** Try using a different camera or device. If the problem persists with the same note, manual input is required.

### Error message: **"Unable to Contact Servers"**  
- **REASON:** The application cannot process your request because it needs to consult the Daley Dose Database.  
- **SOLUTION:** Ensure that the internet connection remains consistent throughout the process and try again.
